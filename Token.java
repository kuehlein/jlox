// some token implementations store the location as two numbers: the offset from the beginning of
// the source file to the beginning of the lexeme, and the length of the lexeme. The scanner needs
// to know these anyway, so there's no overhead to calculate them.

// an offset can be converted to line and column positions later by looking back at the source file
// and counting the preceding newlines. That sounds slow, and it is. However, you need to do it only
// when you need to actually display a line and column to the user. Most tokens never appear in an
// error message. For those, the less time you spend calculating position information ahead of time,
// the better
